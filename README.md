# üìö NLP Analysis on NYT Bestselling Non-Fiction Books

---

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to the descriptions of **New York Times Bestselling Non-Fiction Books**.  
We focus on two major tasks:

- **Text Summarization** to generate concise summaries of the book descriptions.
- **Emotion Detection** to identify the emotional tone conveyed in each description.

The project uses libraries like **NLTK**, **spaCy**, **text2emotion**, **sumy**, and **TextBlob** to perform advanced text analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Workflow

- **Data Loading**: Load the NYT bestselling books dataset.
- **Summarization**: Use LexRank algorithm (Sumy library) to generate short summaries.
- **Emotion Detection**: Detect emotions (Happy, Angry, Sad, Surprise, Fear) using text2emotion.
- **Visualization**: Create a bar plot to visualize overall emotional distribution across all books.
- **Saving Results**: Store enhanced data (summaries and emotions) into a clean CSV.
