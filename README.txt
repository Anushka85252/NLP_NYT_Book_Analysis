# NLP Analysis on NYT Bestselling Non-Fiction Books

‚ú® Project Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the descriptions of New York Times Bestselling Non-Fiction Books.
We focus on two major tasks:

Text Summarization to generate concise summaries of the book descriptions.

Emotion Detection to identify the emotional tone conveyed in each description.

The project uses libraries like NLTK, spaCy, text2emotion, sumy, and TextBlob to perform advanced text analysis.

Data Loading: Load the NYT bestselling books dataset.

Summarization: Use LexRank algorithm (Sumy library) to generate short summaries.
